# Personal Website Backend

There are three versions of website:
* React.js + API, using the UI from `../frontend`
	* Can be started by `batch/run.bat`
* Server side rendering, managed by `webPageGoals.go`
	* Can be started by `batch/run.bat` as well and accessed at `/pages`
* Static files, generated by `webStaticGoals.go`
	* Can be generated by `batch/generate.bat` while the main server is running
	* The files will be saved into `static` folder
