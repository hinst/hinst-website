My new personal website is up:
🌐 https://hinst.github.io/
📜 https://github.com/hinst/hinst-website


For content, it has my blog posts on topics Coding and Cycling.
The blog posts are available in three languages: Russian, English and German. Russian is the original, meanwhile English and German are translated by a Large Language Model.
Also, I tried to optimize it for both wide (desktop) and narrow (mobile) screens.
